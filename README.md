# BWAIShotgunRunner
Script and description for running BWAIShotgun in a Windows Sandbox.

For installing Windows Sandbox, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-overview

1. Open a new Windows Sandbox.
2. Copy the folder "shotgun" to the desktop. (the folder, not just the contents)
3. Right-click "setup.ps1" and "Run with PowerShell".

The script will download Starcraft and BWAIShotgun, install dependencies and a Java 8 JRE. When it is done you should be able to run BWAIShotgun.

TODO: Perhaps add way to download bots from SSCAIT?
