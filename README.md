# BWAIShotgunRunner
Script and description for running BWAIShotgun in a Windows Sandbox.

1. Install Windows Sandbox, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-sandbox/windows-sandbox-overview
2. Open a new Windows Sandbox.
3. Copy the folder "shotgun" to the desktop. (the folder, not just the contents)

The script will download Starcraft and BWAIShotgun, install dependencies and start a bot match.

TODO: Install Java. Perhaps add way to download bots from SSCAIT.
